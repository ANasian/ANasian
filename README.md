- 👋 Hi, I’m @nasiand and I'm currently live in Italy Hello EveryOne!

Trying to switch my professional career towards the beautiful software development world! I'm doing my best for succeding but it's not easy to get noticed since I have a MS in Business Management. BUT I want to switch, so I'm here for studying and learning by doing.

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Programming and everything related to the coding and tech world
- 🌱 Learning the basic of Programming, CS foundamentals and Web development because I really want to push myself in a carrer-change towards 
     these fields - Currently enrolled in <<Le Wagon Web Programming Bootcamp batch #648>> :weight_lifting_man:
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with whoever has the willingness of teaming up with a person with currently low experience but determined in reaching his goals
     and learn programming to bring value.
